# ‚úÖ STIG Remediation Process: WN10-00-000155

**STIG ID:** WN10-00-000155

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## üßæ Personal Implementation Notes

This document outlines the exact step-by-step process I followed to manually and programmatically remediate STIG **WN10-00-000155** on a Windows 10 virtual machine. Each stage includes screenshots, testing steps, and a PowerShell script I created based on STIG guidance.

## üîç Initial Assessment

* Identified **WN10-00-000155** as failed in the initial Tenable STIG scan.

* Confirmed the baseline scan used correct DISA STIG benchmark (Windows 10 v3r1).

* **Description:**
  `Windows PowerShell 2.0 must be disabled on the system.`
  PowerShell 2.0 is outdated and lacks modern security features. It should be disabled to reduce attack surface.

* Manual Fix Steps:

  1. Open **Windows Features** (optionalfeatures.exe)
  2. Locate **Windows PowerShell 2.0**
  3. Uncheck the feature (turn off)
  4. Click **OK** and allow Windows to apply changes
  5. Restart the system if prompted

## üîÅ Revert & Recheck

* Reversed the setting to simulate noncompliance:

  * Re-enabled **Windows PowerShell 2.0** in Windows Features
  * Applied and completed change

* üì∏ Screenshot: Windows PowerShell 2.0 turned back on

## ‚ö° PowerShell Remediation

* PowerShell fix was provided in STIG-A-VIEW, but I created my own version for practice:
