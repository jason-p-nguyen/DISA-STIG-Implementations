# ‚úÖ STIG Remediation Process: WN10-00-000155

**STIG ID:** WN10-00-000155

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## üßæ Personal Implementation Notes

This document outlines the exact step-by-step process I followed to manually and programmatically remediate STIG **WN10-00-000155** on a Windows 10 virtual machine. Each stage includes screenshots, testing steps, and a PowerShell script I created based on STIG guidance.

## üîç Initial Assessment

* Identified **WN10-00-000155** as failed in the initial Tenable STIG scan.

* Confirmed the baseline scan used correct DISA STIG benchmark (Windows 10 v3r1).

* **Description:**
  `Windows PowerShell 2.0 must be disabled on the system.`
  PowerShell 2.0 is outdated and lacks modern security features. It should be disabled to reduce attack surface.

## üõ† Manual Remediation

* Researched manual fix using:

  * [STIG-A-VIEW WN10-00-000155](https://stigaview.com/products/win10/v3r1/WN10-00-000155/)
    ![Stig-a-view](screenshots/2_STIG-A-VIEW.png)

* Manual Fix Steps:

  1. Open **Windows Features**

## üîÅ Revert & Recheck

* Reversed the setting to simulate noncompliance:

  * Re-enabled **Windows PowerShell 2.0** in Windows Features

## ‚ö° PowerShell Remediation

* PowerShell fix was provided in STIG-A-VIEW, but I created my own version for practice using ChatGPT:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Disables Windows PowerShell 2.0 and its engine to prevent downgrade attacks.

.DESCRIPTION
    Implements STIG control WN10-00-000155 by disabling:
    - MicrosoftWindowsPowerShellV2Root
    - MicrosoftWindowsPowerShellV2

    This mitigates downgrade attacks that bypass PowerShell 5.x logging features.
