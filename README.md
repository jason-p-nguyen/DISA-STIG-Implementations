# üõ°Ô∏è DISA STIG Implementations

This repository contains hands-on, step-by-step remediation walkthroughs for selected Windows 10 DISA STIGs. Each case study includes:

- ‚úÖ Initial vulnerability detection via Tenable scan
- üõ† Manual remediation steps with screenshots
- ‚ö° PowerShell scripting for automated fixes
- üîÅ Reversion and revalidation testing
- üì¶ Documentation suitable for audits or portfolio use

Each implementation is based on the official DISA STIG benchmarks and tested in a lab VM environment as part of a cybersecurity internship.
